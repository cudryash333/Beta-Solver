# Beta-Solver
It can solve polynomial equations, differentiate and find the extremum points of functions and plot graphics. It uses Newton's method, which will be considered in detail in 5th semester. 

How to use it? Run it and write coefficients in the special window. Program will write down how your equations looks, roots of thix equation in complex form with precision 10^(-4) and will plot graphic of this function.
